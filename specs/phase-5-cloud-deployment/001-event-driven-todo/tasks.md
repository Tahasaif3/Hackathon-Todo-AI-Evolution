- [X] T039 [US2] Test filtering and sorting functionality
- [X] T040 [US2] Verify audit trail displays events in correct chronological order

**Independent Test Criteria**: Users can access a dedicated audit trail page to see a chronological history of all actions performed on their tasks, including who made changes and when they occurred.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Event-Driven System Reliability (P3)

- [X] T041 [US3] Implement event retry mechanism when Kafka is temporarily unavailable
- [X] T042 [US3] Add circuit breaker pattern for Kafka connections
- [X] T043 [US3] Implement dead letter queue for failed events
- [X] T044 [US3] Add event processing monitoring and alerting
- [X] T045 [US3] Implement graceful degradation when audit service is down
- [X] T046 [US3] Add health checks for Kafka connectivity
- [X] T047 [US3] Add metrics collection for event processing

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete User Story 1 (P1) functionality with basic event publishing and audit trail storage, sufficient to demonstrate the core event-driven architecture.

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. MVP: Event publishing and basic audit trail (T001-T029)
2. Enhanced UI: Frontend audit trail page (T030-T040)
3. Reliability: System resilience features (T041-T053)
4. Production: Cloud deployment and CI/CD (T054-T074)
