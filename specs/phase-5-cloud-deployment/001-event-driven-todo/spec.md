## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Track Todo Tasks with Event Auditing (Priority: P1)

Users can create, update, complete, and delete todo tasks through the UI, with all operations automatically logged in an audit trail that can be viewed later. This ensures accountability and provides visibility into task changes over time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that extends the existing todo system with the new event-driven architecture, providing immediate value by enabling audit capabilities that are critical for enterprise systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks, performing various operations on them, and verifying that audit logs are generated and accessible. Delivers the core value of event-driven architecture with audit trail visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they create a new todo task, **Then** the task is saved and an audit event is recorded showing the creation
2. **Given** a user has created a task, **When** they update the task, **Then** the changes are saved and an audit event is recorded showing the update
3. **Given** a user has created a task, **When** they delete the task, **Then** the task is removed and an audit event is recorded showing the deletion
4. **Given** a user has created a task, **When** they mark the task as complete, **Then** the status is updated and an audit event is recorded showing the completion

---

### User Story 2 - View Complete Audit Trail (Priority: P2)

Users can access a dedicated audit trail page to see a chronological history of all actions performed on their tasks, including who made changes and when they occurred.

**Why this priority**: This provides transparency and accountability for users, allowing them to track the history of their tasks and understand how they evolved over time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing various task operations, then navigating to the audit trail page to verify that all events are properly displayed in chronological order with relevant details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has performed multiple task operations, **When** they visit the audit trail page, **Then** they see a chronological list of all events related to their tasks
2. **Given** audit events exist for a user's tasks, **When** they filter the audit trail, **Then** they can see events of specific types (created, updated, deleted, completed)

---

### User Story 3 - Event-Driven System Reliability (Priority: P3)

The system reliably processes and stores all task events even when individual services experience temporary failures, ensuring no audit data is lost.

**Why this priority**: This ensures the integrity and reliability of the audit system, which is crucial for maintaining trust in the system's ability to track changes accurately.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating service failures during task operations and verifying that events are eventually processed and stored once services recover.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the audit service is temporarily unavailable, **When** a user performs a task operation, **Then** the event is eventually processed once the service recovers
2. **Given** the system experiences high load, **When** multiple task operations occur simultaneously, **Then** all events are captured and stored without loss

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Kafka is temporarily unavailable during a task operation? The system should queue events and retry delivery when connectivity is restored.
- How does the system handle duplicate events to prevent double-processing? Each event should be uniquely identified and the system should handle duplicates gracefully.
- What if a user attempts to access audit events for tasks they don't own? The system should return only events related to tasks owned by the authenticated user.
- How does the system behave when the audit log database is full or experiencing performance issues? The system should continue to function but may temporarily delay audit logging with appropriate error handling.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST publish events to Kafka for every task operation (create, update, delete, complete) via Dapr Pub/Sub
- **FR-002**: System MUST store all task-related events in an audit log database with event_id, timestamp, user_id, task_id, and event_data
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to access their audit trail through a dedicated API endpoint at `/api/{user_id}/audit`
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure events are processed exactly once to prevent duplicate audit records
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate JWT tokens and ensure users can only access their own audit events
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide real-time audit event processing with maximum 5-second delay from task operation to audit record
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain audit event data for at least 7 days as specified in the event schema
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle service failures gracefully and ensure eventual consistency of audit logs
- **FR-009**: System MUST support concurrent task operations without losing audit events
- **FR-010**: System MUST include comprehensive error handling and logging for event processing failures

### Key Entities

- **Task Event**: Represents a state change operation on a task, containing event_id (UUID), event_type (created|updated|completed|deleted), timestamp, user_id, task_id, and task_data
- **Audit Log**: Persistent record of all task events for a user, containing id, event_id, event_type, user_id, task_id, event_data (JSONB), and timestamp
- **User**: Identity associated with task operations and audit trail access, authenticated via JWT tokens
- **Task**: Core todo item with title, description, completion status, and ownership tied to a user

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
